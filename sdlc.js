/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 


const Analysis_of_Requirements = "Once the team has  come up with some ideas, it's time to organize them into a cohesive plan and design. This requires a lot of research and planning to ensure that your final product meets your expectations (and those of your customers). The big step is creating a detailed project plan document and work breakdown structure that outlines the requirements.Once the requirement is clearly understood, the SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is created. This document should be thoroughly understood by the developers and also should be reviewed by the customer for future reference";

const Design = " The team starts creating a design plan that explains all major aspects of the new product, including its Architecture (programming language, databases, interfaces, operating system, pre-made templates, APIs, etc.), Features list, Infrastructure requirements.UI design, Necessary security measures (e.g., SSL encryption, password protection, recommended database migrations, etc.). The team gathers this info in the Design Document Specification (DDS).";

const Implementation =  "Implementation/Coding starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented in this phase."

const Testing_And_Integration = "The team will test the application to ensure it is free of bugs and errors. Any issues need to be fixed before moving forward with deployment.Once all testing phases are completed, it's time to deploy the new application for customers to use. After deployment, the launch may involve marketing the new product or service so people know about its existence. If the software is in-house, it may mean implementing the change management process to ensure user training and acceptance."

const Maintain = "The final stage of the software development life cycle is maintenance and operations .Maintenance involves updating an existing software product to fix bugs and ensure reliability. It can also include adding new features or functionality to a current product. Operations refer to the day-to-day running of a software product or service, such as performing backups and other administrative tasks."
